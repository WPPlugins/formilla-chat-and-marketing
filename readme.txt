Provide online chat support to your visitors and view them navigate your website or store from page to page, along with the ability to view the contents of their shopping cart.

**Formilla's Features:**

* **Installs Instantly:** You'll be up and running within minutes once you install the plugin to your WooCommerce or WordPress site and sign-up for a Formilla account.  The live chat widget will appear on your site upon installation/activation of this plugin and you can configure all the options in your Formilla.com cloud account without touching any site code!

* **Pro-active Chat:** Enable pro-active chat to trigger live chat automatically with a visitor after a defined number of seconds.

* **Shopping Cart Details:** When using WooCommerce (WordPress ecommerce plugin), Formilla will automatically display a visitor's shopping cart contents in real time during a chat.  If you're using one of our premium packages, you can also view your most active visitors' shopping cart contents using the visitor monitoring feature from the live chat dashboard.  Know what products visitors have added to their shopping cart, the quantity of each item, sub-total, and grand total.  Use proactive chat or request chat functionality to ensure customers purchase before they leave your website.  

* **Email Collection Widgets:** Continually grow your email list with our beautiful email collection widgets and popups. 

* **Facebook and Twitter Social Media Widgets:** Increase your Facebook Likes and Twitter Followers using our social media widgets.  

* **Custom Messaging Campaigns:** Display custom in-app messages to customers at the perfect time, based on various criteria and/or visitor behavior. What's the result? Much higher conversions. If you're looking to encourage customers to download your mobile app, up-sell or cross-sell products, purchase an additional product accessory, take advantage of a huge sale, and the list goes on, you can benefit tremendously from Formilla Edge. It's all about delivering the right message, to the right customer, at the right time; execute this properly, and you'll see your conversions drastically rise.  This is a Premium package option.  

* **Multiple Display Types:** Configure in-app messages using pop modals, top and bottom website bars, corner widgets, or live chat widgets to display messages in the format that makes sense for a given webpage or visitor.   

* **Custom Fields:** Pass in custom parameters and customer data from your website to Formilla.com for more powerful marketing automation and easier tracking, such as account IDs, customer IDs, customer name, phone, and more.   

* **Timing and Scroll-based Triggers:** Display email, social, and custom in-app messages after a defined number of seconds (e.g. after 15 seconds), or to automatically popup if the visitor scrolls on your website. Also control how often to display each message campaign to a visitor by selecting Always, One Time, Daily, Monthly, etc.

* **Real-time Visitor Monitoring:** Formilla's real-time visitor monitoring/tracking allows you to see the number of active visitors on your website, and initiate live chats with them.  View visitor login email, where your visitor is located, their recently viewed web pages, what operating system (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, etc.) or internet browser they are using, where the traffic came from (Google, Facebook, other linking sites, etc.), whether they are a new or returning visitor, and more.  Formilla visitor monitoring comes with any of our Premium account packages.

* **Multiple Live Chat Agents:** Our Premium packages allow you to add multiple chat agents to your Formilla.com Live Chat account to support incoming live chats from your customers.  Using Chat Broadcast, all your online chat agents are notified of an incoming chat and can accept or decline the chat based on their immediate availability.  They can also transfer a chat message back and forth with other available chat agents and provide a private message to provide additional details with the transfer.   

* **Require Email Address:**  Before visitors start a live chat, you can require them to supply their email address and include them in future marketing opportunities.  

* **Offline Email Form:** Formilla will automatically display an offline 'Email us' contact button on your site when you're unavailable to chat.  You can manage offline messages through the Formilla.com Customer Inbox or on the go by using your preferred email client.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I install Formilla Customer Support Software on my website? =
The fastest way to install is to use this plugin; simply activate the plugin and choose Formilla from the WordPress admin menu. You'll see a link to **Sign Up** for a Formilla account and use the Plugin ID you receive to activate the plugin. You can alternatively copy and paste your unique Formilla code snippet to your webpage(s) instead. To get the code snippet, login to your Formilla.com account > Click Widgets in the menu > then click the pencil icon to view/edit your default chat widget. On the following page, you can retrieve the code in the top-right area of the page and you'll see simple instructions to copy/paste into each of your webpages. Note: you only need to install this once to power all of your widgets.

= How does real-time visitor monitoring work?  Do you have a demo? = 
Check out our [real-time visitor monitoring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhsEFWbydyU "real time visitor monitoring") video for a short tutorial of the functionality.  

= Does Formilla work with standard WordPress sites that do not use WooCommerce? =
Yes, this plugin easily installs with any WordPress website. Install and activate the plugin from within your WordPress/WooCommerce admin panel.

= Can I specify my hours of operation or simply that I am unavailable to chat? =
Yes, simply login to your Formilla.com account and navigate to your live chat widget's settings by selecting from the menu as follows: Select **Widgets** from the live chat dashboard menu, then select the edit icon of your chat widget. You can modify the hours of operation from the **Widget Details** tab.

= I've followed all the instructions but I still appear offline and see the "Email us" button on my site. How do I go online and get the button to say "Chat with us"? =
You must login to Formilla (the chat client) using the web dashboard, desktop app for Windows, or our mobile apps for iPhone or Android devices.  Once you've logged in and navigated to the Live Chat dashboard (**Dashboard** from the main menu), you're considered online and ready to accept chats. Ensure your live chat status indicator says **Online** in the header bar, of course. If you log off, your button will go to offline mode and display "Email us". 

= Can I proactively initiate a live chat session with my customers? =
Yes, simply login to your Formilla account and navigate to your live chat widget's Advanced Options tab by selecting from the menu as follows: Select **Widgets** from the live chat dashboard menu, then select the edit icon of your chat widget and check the **'Enable Auto Display'** field to configure proactive chat from the **Advanced Options** tab.

= My email subscriber widget only displayed once when testing, although it will not appear again. What can I do to continue testing? = 
The default setting for Formilla Edge widgets (e.g. email collection and social widgets, or custom in-app messaging widgets) is to display **Once per Visit** and in 15 seconds. With this configuration, the widget will not display again until you close your entire browser (all tabs) and revisit your website. If you have already submitted an email address (e.g. using the email widget modal or email website bar for example), clicked to Like or Follow on Facebook/Twitter, or clicked the call-to-action button on a custom messaging widget, it will not display for your browser as you have now interacted with the widget. In this case, you can test with a different browser, or modify the settings from the **Behaviors** tab to display the widget more frequently. For instance, we recommend setting the widget to display Always and to set the "Display if user has already interacted with it?" option to Yes. This way, you'll continuously see the widget while you're testing.

= Does Formilla offer mobile apps and how can I install them on my iPhone, iPad, or Android device? = 
Our mobile apps currently support our live chat customer support software only. To view any collected email addresses or Formilla Edge analytics reports, please login to your Formilla account from a web browser. To download our mobile apps for live chat, you can do so from the Apple App store for iPhone and iPad devices, or the Google Play store if you're using an Android smartphone or tablet. You can also search "formilla" to find and install the app for your particular device (Premium option).
